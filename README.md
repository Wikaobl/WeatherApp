## Desription

This page displays weather information such as temperature and humidity for a selected city. You can choose the city yourself. The pictures change depending on the weather (sunny, cloudy, stormy etc.). In case you enter a city that does not exist, the error “**Please enter a valid city name!**” pops out. To create this website I used **_JS, HTML and CSS_**, along with the **_Open Weather API_**.

## Usage

First, run the development server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wikaobl/WeatherApp
```

Next, install dependencies

```bash
cd WeatherApp
npm install
```

Run the project

```bash
npm run
```

After successfully starting the project, open your web browser and go to the specified URL http://localhost:3000

### Enjoy!
